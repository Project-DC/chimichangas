# Contributing to PyGeneses   

### Please star (‚≠ê) the repository to show your support to the project.   

## Pull Requests (PRs)

- PR will be reviewed within a maximum of 24 hours of submitting the request.
- The following rules are to be followed while submitting a PR:-
	- <strong>Branch Name</strong>: The name of the branch should start with 'in' followed by hyphen (-) and the issue number. Eg:- If you are working on issue number 57 then your branch name should be in-57. You need to make sure that in your fork you create a branch following this pattern.
	- <strong>Commit Message</strong>: Commit message should make sense, anyone should be able to get an idea of what changes were made in that particular commit. Irrelevant or inapporpriate commit messages are highly discouraged.
	- <strong>Docstrings</strong>: Docstrings are special comments in python which helps one to understand what a function or class does, the parameters passed, and the data returned from that function. We tend to follow a similar syntax for javascript too, we expect everyone to adhere to the format in your code. To get a better idea of the format of docstrings, please refer to the codebase.
	- <strong>Comments</strong>: The comments should be meaningful and one should be able to understand what the line(s) of code mean from the comments. Do not add unecessary comments in each line, leave out comments from code which is self-explanatory. 
	- <strong>Variables</strong>: Variable names used in your code should explain what the variable is. Some unacceptable variable names are:- a, b, hello, world, etc.  While creating variable name with multiple words in it, the words should be separated by underscore (_) e.g:- player_initial_energy and should not be written in camel case e.g- playerInitialEnergy.
- Failing to adhere to any of the above mentioned rules will lead to closing of your PR by a maintainer.
- After successful submission of PR, it will be subjected to automated testing and if the code fails any of the tests you will be given a time period of 3 days to fix the issue, else your PR will be closed.

## New Issue (New feature or bug)

- The time period for reviewing of a new issue is a maximum of 36 hours, you can expect to hear from a maintainer within this/
- The implementation of the new feature or fixing of the bug should only be started after a maintainer approves the feature or bug report in the discussion. 
- Once approved start implementing the feature or fix the bug and submit a pull request.

## Unit Testing

- Make sure you test your code using the inbuilt testing before you make a PR. 
- To test your code, the steps are as follows:-
	1) Navigate to the repository using terminal or command prompt (in windows).
	2) Change directory to test
	```bash
	user@programmer~:$ cd test/
	```
  3) Run main.py
	```bash
	user@programmer~:$ python main.py
	```
  4) If any test fails make sure to fix your code so that the error goes away. PR will be deleted if it does not pass the tests. 
  
## Instructions for first time contributors/beginner level contributors for question related issues during HACKTOBERFEST

- Start working on the issues once you are assigned to them. Head over to the issue and comment that you want it to be assigned to you. Once the maintainer assigns the issue to you, start working on it. Issues will be assigned on a First Come First Serve (FCFS) basis.
- Once the issue is assigned, you have one week (7 Days) to submit the PR. Failing to do so will get the issue reassigned to someone else. As each issue related to questions are being assigned to single contributor at a time, we sincerely hope that you cooperate with us.
- If you create a PR without the issue being assigned to you, the PR will be marked spam as you are not adhering to the rules.   
- The google drive link to logs that you generate have to placed in the location logs/ directory. If not found in the right place, our maintainers would write a comment to the PR as a warning and if the correct location is still not provided on the resubmission, the PR would be marked spam for not adhering to the rules.

## How to work on the generate logs issues?

1) Check which hyperparameter you have to tune, the values that you have to tune it for, and the stop_at number in the issue.

2) Write code in pygeneses for that (3 line code). Let's take an example where hyperparameter to be tuned is **initial_population**, the values for that are **[10, 20, 50, 90, 100]**, and stop_at number is **2000**, then the code will look something like this:-

```python
from pygeneses.hypertune import HyperTune

tuner = HyperTune(model_class='PrimaVita',
                  hyperparameters=['initial_population'],
                  values=[[10, 20, 50, 90, 100]],
                  stop_at=2000)

tuner.hypertuner()
```

3) After training there will be a folder generated in the same location where you trained the Prima vita agents, this folder's name will start with Players_Data, this is the logs that we require. You can either zip this or directly upload the entire folder to google drive.

4) Once you have uploaded the logs into google drive share the link of that folder (or zip file) containing logs in a file named with the issue number in txt format (e.g. if you are doing issue 11 then file name should be 11.txt). This file is to be put in the logs directory before creating the Pull Request. Once you create PR wait for a maintainer to merge it or ask for some changes.

## General Hacktoberfest Rules

- After submission of Pull Request (PR) we (the maintainers) get a period of seven (7) days to either merge or close your issue. 
- Your pull request gets counted in Hacktoberfest site in one of the two situations:-
	1) We merge your PR into our codebase.
	2) We did not take any action, i.e. neither merged nor closed.
- If in this 7 day period we close your PR, then it would not be counted as a PR in the hacktoberfest portal.
